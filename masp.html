    <h1 class="titles">MASP - Museu de Arte de S達o Paulo</h1>

      <p class="body-txt">For this assignment, we were divided into groups of 3 and were supposed to research about an already existing building from a given list. We had to analyze its structure and understand how it was built in order to replicate a sectional model of it. My group chose the S達o Paulo Museum of Art located in S達o Paulo, Brazil. </p>

      <p class="body-txt">Information was gathered using resources such as online papers, websites and ebooks. Two sectional drawings were used as guide, and a drawing was made as one of the required deliverables.</p>

      <p class="body-txt">After all information was gathered and schematic drawings and sketches were made, a sectional model at 1/4"= 1'0" scale was built. An acrylic sheet was placed at the right end so that the model could stand. The purpose of using the acrylic as a material was to maximize visibility.</p>
