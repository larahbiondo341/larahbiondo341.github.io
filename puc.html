    <h1 class="titles">PUC-Rio Student Center</h1>

      <p class="body-txt"> While I studied at PUC-Rio, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, we were asked to design an Architecture student center that would (theoretically) be built on a specific lot inside the university. </p>

      <h2 class="titles">Pre-Desgin Phase</h2>

      <p class="body-txt">The pre-design phase was composed of an analysis of the condition of the site such as sunlight, wind, circulation, and everything we judged important in order to design a student center that would successfully fulfill the student’s needs. </br>
      Here are some examples of relevant information we gathered:</p>

        <figcaption class="caps">(1. Location; 2. Applied Psychology Service; 3. Entrance through Marquês de São Vicente Street; 4. Entrance to SOLAR building; 5. Directory Villa; 6. Entrance to FRINGS building.)</figcaption>

        <figcaption class="caps">(1. Morphology; 2. Space-defining elements; 3. Natural definers; 4. Built definers.)</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p class="body-txt">After analyzing the site, we made a surrounding model of the site, so that we could then fit each individual model design into the bigger one once they were done.</p>

      <h2 class="titles">Design Phase</h2>

      <p class="body-txt">Once done with the site analysis, the individual phase of the project began: the actual process of designing our own building.</p>
      <p class="body-txt">First, I thought about what exactly I would do with the ground of the site. It had a subtle inclination, but adding up, it would make my life as an architect much more difficult. Therefore, I decided to carve the surface and create a small plaza that would be embraced by the building itself:</p>

      <p class="body-txt">When thinking about doing the plaza, my goal became clear: create a building that would surround this plaza, making it comfortable for students to socialize on the outside as well as study inside of the building. The whole idea was that students would feel as if the building was embracing the plaza.</p>
