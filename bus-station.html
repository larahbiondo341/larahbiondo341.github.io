    <h1 class="titles">Omni Loop Bus Station</h1>

    <p class="body-txt">Miami is one of the most populated metropolitan areas in the nation, yet its public transportation system is not considered to satisfy the demand and needs of nearly 6,000,000 people. The Omni Station Bus Terminal is located at the center of the Arts & Entertainment District and is used by thousands daily, and waiting times could be as long as 30 minutes. There are currently a total of 25 seats available for those waiting. Even though the seats are covered, during several hours of the day they are exposed to intense direct sunlight and rain.</p>

    <p class="body-txt">The project is to design a new roof structure for the Omni Bus Terminal that addresses the above mentioned problems, while improving the visual landscape on the site.</p>

    <p class="body-txt">The design was to base based on a modular system. A modular design with as many prefabricated parts guaranteed short on site construction and assembly time. The emphasis of the project was the study of steel construction, and so I decided to use it in conjuction with solar panels throughout.</p>

    <p class="body-txt">I also took into consideration the sunlight path (sunrise and sunset) and did the roof tilted towards it so that people would have more protection against sunlight. The solar panels were interleaved with glas for more sunlight, which produced a beautiful pattern on the ground. At night, the lights would use the solar panel's energy. At the end, a model of the module was made at a 1/4" = 1'0" scale.</p>
