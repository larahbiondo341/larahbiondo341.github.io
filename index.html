    <h1>Larah Garcez Biondo</h1>

    <p>Hi! This is my first web page! Let me tell you a little bit about myself... I was born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, but have studied my whole life in an American school, so I've always dreamed of going to college in the US. I am an Architecture major student in University of Miami with cognates in Psychology and Multimedia Design!!</p>

    <h2>Things I like to do:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Going to the beach</li>
      <li>Playing volleyball</li>
      <li>Reading</li>
      <li>Play with my dogs</li>
    </ul>
